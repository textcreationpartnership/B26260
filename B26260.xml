            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <l>Her father was a farmer,</l>
               <l>Who did at Ryegate dwell,</l>
               <l>Just by liv'd a noble Lord,</l>

               <l>The draught of love he drank so sweet</l>
               <l>By gazing on her charms,</l>
               <l>That the sweet creature he would oft</l>
               <l>W sh for in his arms,</l>
               <l>He said, I've slighted ladies,</l>
               <l>Of honour, birth, and fame:</l>
               <l>Now Cupid has betray'd me</l>
               <l>To an innocent country dame.</l>
               <l>I must reveal my passion.</l>
               <l>Or for her lose my life;</l>
               <l>If money her virtue will overcome.</l>
               <l>I soon will end the strise.</l>
               <l>Next morning he goes to her,</l>
               <l>As she a-milking were,</l>
               <l>And he began the story</l>
               <l>To the farmer's daughter fair.</l>
               <l>Thou fairest of all creatures,</l>
               <l>My heart is in love with thee;</l>
               <l>If thou can'st love a London Lord,</l>
               <l>A Lady thou shalt be.</l>
               <l>Sir, said she, What do you mean,</l>
               <l>More fit I am, I vow,</l>
               <l>To mind my father's dairy,</l>
               <l>And feed the pigs and sow.</l>
               <l>I cannot dress up in the mode,</l>
               <l>As London lasses wear.</l>
               <l>Said he, but I will keep a maid,</l>
               <l>To wait on thee, my dear.</l>
               <l>A maid! said the country lass,</l>
               <l>I can but laugh at that:</l>
               <l>Must I ride to the church in my short cloak,</l>
               <l>With a feather in my cap?</l>
               <l>No, no, my dear, that is the dress</l>
               <l>My jewel thou shalt were,</l>
               <l>When thou along with me dost go</l>
               <l>To take the rural air.</l>
               <l>Then, Gaffer, said the country girl,</l>
               <l>Yet something I've to say,</l>
               <l>Among the ladies I cannot dance,</l>

               <l>But thou can'st dance in bed, my dear,</l>
               <l>And that's the prettiest sport.</l>
               <l>Ay, never fear, I'll warrent thee,</l>
               <l>As well as the best at court.</l>
               <l>This was Right COUNTRY COURTSHIP,</l>
               <l>And made the Lord to smile,</l>
               <l>But his whole intention was</l>
               <l>This maiden to beguile.</l>
               <l>But the country girls are not such fools,</l>
               <l>For to be taken in,</l>
               <l>So now come here the country bite,</l>
               <l>Which she did put on him.</l>
               <l>He made her many presents</l>
               <l>Of watches, jewels, rings,</l>
               <l>The girl she was well pleas'd</l>
               <l>At sight of such fine things.</l>
               <l>The cow-house was the chamber</l>
               <l>In which they us'd to court:</l>

               <l>There's no harm, says he, my dear.</l>
               <l>We serve the ladies so.</l>
               <l>I do not like the fashion,</l>
               <l>The country girl reply'd.</l>
               <l>I will not be a lady</l>
               <l>Until I am a bride.</l>

               <l>But I'll bite him of a portion,</l>
               <l>Then wed with Ralph my dear.</l>
               <l>Next morning came the Lord,</l>
               <l>As he was us'd to do,</l>
               <l>With a pretence to drink the milk</l>
               <l>Warm sir from the cow.</l>
               <l>Then with the charming milk-maid</l>
               <l>Still fooling he would be,</l>
               <l>Says he, five hundred pounds I'll give</l>
               <l>One night to lie with thee;</l>
               <l>Then afterwards I will thee wed,</l>
               <l>So no barm can there be.</l>
               <l>Well, If I lose my maidenhead,</l>
               <l>It shall be in my father's barn:</l>
               <l>So now the money put me down,</l>
               <l>And treat me well with wine,</l>
               <l>Then to-night at twelve o'clock,</l>
               <l>It is the only time.</l>
               <l>He was delighted for to catch</l>
               <l>The maiden in the mind,</l>
               <l>Then unto the barn he took</l>

               <l>A gang of Gypsies us'd to lie,</l>
               <l>Sir in the barn all night,</l>

               <l>I beg that you would tie.</l>
               <l>Both his hands I have made fast</l>
               <l>Not easy to be undone,</l>
               <l>Then as he rises in a fright,</l>
               <l>Like a devil he will run.</l>
               <l>Five pound she to the gypsies gave,</l>
               <l>Then home she strait did steer.</l>
               <l>The Lord began to awake, sir,</l>
               <l>In the morning fair and clear.</l>
               <l>He took a roll upon his back,</l>
               <l>The gypsy began to squeak,</l>
               <l>His hands being ty'd he then began</l>
               <l>To scramble on his feet.</l>
               <l>The gypsies all were standing up,</l>
               <l>Their coal-black hair hung down,</l>
               <l>He took them all for devils in bust,</l>
               <l>And run into the town,</l>

               <l>His wig was tag'd with straw,</l>
               <l>Sure such a sight as this</l>
               <l>No mortal ever saw.</l>
               <l>The servants were amazed</l>
               <l>When they did let him in,</l>
               <l>They took the gppsy from his back,</l>
